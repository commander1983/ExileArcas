### What is ExileAltis?


### What do I need to play?


### Hosting
A guide to install this server/mission files will be posted here when the files are released for v0.1

### My Wishes and Requests
Since I cannot put a copyright on a mission/server file, I've created a list below of things I would love it if people did.
* If you want to use this mission and server files, please give credit where credit is due.
* If you use the mission and server files and edit them, please give me credit for the initial base files where credit is due.
* **Do not, for any reason,** remove my copyright on the scripts that I wrote from scratch.
* I want to keep the server following the below guidelines
    * Immersion is key!
    * Not militarized, but armed vehicles are acceptable
    * Things to be challenging but not impossible
    * Survival feel and gameplay
    * Role playing as much as possible, give everyone a chance
