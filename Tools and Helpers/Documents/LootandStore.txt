// 				Store and Loot					 //

Idea:

ARCAS program has a lot of weapons and clothing available for the user to have access to. I am also tired of servers being all about loot and taking a player no time what so ever to get enough money to have a decent gun/equipment. So this is where I'm proposing control over store inventory and loot tables



// STORE INVENTORY

Below are the lists of weapons not going to be available to buy OR sell.

rhs_weap_rpg26
rhs_weap_rshg2
rhs_weap_igla
rhs_weap_rpg7
rhs_weap_M136
rhs_weap_M136_hedp
rhs_weap_M136_hp
rhs_weap_fim92
rhs_weap_fgm148

AMMO for the above launchers will be for sale for a higher price (roughly 300 a round) except for launchers that come with a rocket in them.
