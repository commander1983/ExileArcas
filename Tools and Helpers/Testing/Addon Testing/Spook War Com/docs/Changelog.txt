-DIVER-
-FIXED: Added old 'Request Transport'

Plus numerous other changes and tweaks I can't remember!

NOTICE: ONLY the MC-130J is currently supported right now in the HALO Mod. I will add back in the other aircraft later.

I got sick of updating all aircraft for every change. For now, ONLY the MC-130J Commando II will be the TEST Aircraft.

You can DL this Mod from the USAF Pack (see above).

The re-write for HALO should be very stable for MP now. (I did NOT get around to Dedicated Server stuff yet) There

will be NO airborne aircraft at the start if using the HALO Module. You have to file a Flight Plan with the JumpMaster

to select where you what the GREEN/GO Signal. You can start to see where I'm going with this hopefully.

The Ground Operation will be separate from the Airborne Operation. Allowing you to have one kind of plane (or none),

on the ground, and a completely different one as the Jump Plane for different altitudes and options.

So there will be a small delay until the next update to v0.1.0 Beta. That one will hopefully include the CORE Module,

an updated HALO System, and my own C-130 that will be included so you won't have to download the USAF Mod

which I think was 1.5 gigs (can't remember, but its huge).

The big upgrade for this update is mostly the NEW D.A.R.K System. Its the Enemy Spawn System. Make sure you

read the (rough draft) doc now included for a breif introduction to it.

ALWAYS, always, keep in mind this is NOT a finished project. Not even close. There are several bugs, issues, and

large sections of code that are not done yet. I have just the ONE Module (I think) to finish up, before I come back

around and and start to put a lot more polish on it and tie everything togeather.

I'm probably forgetting a bunch since I always rush the last minute stuff and upload then type this when I'm too tired.

Anyhow... Let me know how this update works. Good luck!!!
