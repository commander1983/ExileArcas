D.A.R.K - Dynamic ArmA Roleplaying Kombat
=========================================

VQI DARK is the Enemy Spawn Sub-System for the 
SpookWarCom Spec-Ops/Black-Ops Module.

	* Work-In-Progress *

It can also be used as a UNIT or Vehicle Spawn
generic system in general. You can select ANY
Faction to Spawn for EACH catergory. Which means
for example: you could Spawn BLUFOR Infantry,
AAF Armor, and OPFOR Helicopters. Mix & Match!

The choice is yours.

It was designed as the Enemy Occupation System
for our games. But with the Options, you can
setup the system any way you wish. You can select
just ONE side for ALL catergories, or Mix them
for real Ambient Combat and a WarZone.


-------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: The System can be fully configured by the
player now. Below were the test defaults.
-------------------------------------------------

60% - Rogue Units:
These are guerilla/black-ops units. They have 
a high probability of seeking out buildings.
(These are the "movie-style", non-armored guys)

40% - Infantry:
Standard Infantry Groups. Spawns random squads
of both small and large normal military groups.
	50% Standard Infantry (Weapon, Recon, etc)
	30% Support Groups (Mortar, EOD, etc)
	20% Spec-Ops (UAV, UGV, etc)

20% - Vehicles:
Spawns Standard Low/Non-Armored Vehicles, highest
probability towards the Transports and Troops
	65% Transports (80% x3 Troops [Infantry])*
	25% MRAPs (MRAPs, Misc Vehicles, etc)
	10% MRAPs (MRAPs with Turrents, HMG, etc)

*NOTE: The Troops in the Transports, are selected
from your INFANTRY Setting. Be advised.

10% - Helicopters:
Spawns random helicopters set with random tasks and
waypoints. They may Patrol, SAD, Land w/ engine off, 
Attack, etc. Lowest probability towards attack helos.
	65% Multi-Role, Light, Transport (Orcas, etc)
	25% Transport, Misc, etc (Taru, etc)
	10% Attack Helicopters (Kajman, etc)

5% - Armor
Spawns the all the heavy equipment, Tanks, APCs, etc.
High probability towards Lighter, Transport APCs.
	65% APCs (wheeled, transport, etc)
	25% APCs (Tracked, AA, etc)
	10% Heavy Armor (Tanks, Artillery, etc)

----------------------------------------------------

** These Values can and will change (may already have)
over each update. Remind me to update this file after
a few updates. I will be adding MORE options and Units
over time. At some point the Player will be able to
select % values and other options. Stay Tuned!

ENEMY REINFORCEMENTS:
This sub-system is awesome! I've always wanted this in
a game/sim. It simulates the enemys ability to call for
help if it feels they need it.

It also works with the entire focus of this SpookWarCom
System ---> Spec-Ops/Black-Ops.

It gives you WAY more incentive to stay SNEAKY & STEALTHY!
The MORE you give yourself away, and the MORE you stay in
direct combat with the enemy, the MORE LIKELY they will
call for Back-Up Support, like a QRF Team, ParaTroops, and
even ARTILLERY!

If the Enemy greatly out-numbers you, they most likely
will NOT make the Radio Call. If the Enemy does NOT
KNOW about you, or CAN NOT find you, then again will
NOT make the RADIO CALL.

	Example #1: If you run into an Enemy Squad
	out in the bush, and enage all units and can 
	eliminate all of them quicky, NO ONE can make 
	the Radio Call for help.

	Example #2: Same group, you can not eliminate
	that last unit or two. Its taking too much
	time. You can expect that emergency Radio Call
	for help soon!

The Radio Call Timer is RANDOM. 30sec - 5min. If the
squad/unit is small (random as well), AND they feel
threatened, AND they KNOW good intel on you, the MORE
likely they will make the call. This continues to
increase over time AND increases the % with EACH Player!

This also puts an emphesis on SMALL Spec-Ops/Black-Ops
Teams for this style of gameplay. Make sense?

The QRF (Quick Reaction Force) Teams are Trained Trackers!
They have a VERY HIGH probablity of Tracking you down
no matter where you go or hide. The more time that passes,
this probabilty of them tracking you down decreases.

*NOTE: The QRF Troops in the Transports, are selected
from your INFANTRY Setting. Be advised.


The Artillery is always launched with 2 RANDOM Smokes
to mark the area BEFORE they send the Shells. If dark
out, the area will also be lit by Flares as well.

	~Inside Tip: If you can search dead bodies, you
	can sometimes find good INTEL. Like for example
	Radio Frequencies for these RADIO CALLs that
	will qive you a Warning they made the call.  ;)

INTEL:
Which brings me to this. The Items and Intelligence part
of this sub-system. If you set this Option to ON, then
some enemy will have RANDOM Items and Intel on them.

Another HUGE focus of this Spec-Ops/Black-Ops System is
the Intel that can and will exist behind-enemy-lines!

At this point in typing this, I'm NOT going to get into
too much detail here. The Intel and Items you may or may
not find will NOT be obvious as far as what they may or
may not be used for. As an Operative working behind enemy
lines, its upto YOU to figure it out and SOLVE the puzzles 
and work the angles of being a "spook".


To be continued...
