	H.A.L.O. System		by R. Von Quest
------------------------------------------------------

H.A.L.O. High Altitude Low Opening. Is a clandestine
ParaJump technique for stealthy insertion of assets.

The 'HALO' Jump is so high, that special equipment IS
needed to survive the insertion; such as supplemental
Oxygen and Thermal clothing. Often over 30,000ft! ASL.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

START:
------
1. Place BOTH Modules down; set options. Enjoy!


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

USAGE:
------
*. Note#1 - You can check with the JumpMastre BEFORE
   you decide to HALO to check where the Aircraft will
   be over when you get the GREEN JumpLight.

*. Note#2 - You can request a NEW Flight via Map-Click.
   (Low-Level ParaJumps: NO H.A.L.O Equipment Needed if
    using other supported aircraft; "Vampyre" HALO ONLY) 

For H.A.L.O:
1. Gear-up in your normal Combat Loadout. You will also
   need the VQI: Jumpsuit, Helmet, and Re-Breather to
   be able to jump. You can find these in Plane/Crate.

     NOTE: Remember you can pack almost ANYTHING into 
     your Backpack, including your Uniform and Vest.
     You'll have to juggle things around some to pack
     everything you want to jump into the AO with.

     NOTE: For a SCUBA/HALO, wear the Wetsuit in
     place of the SlipStream Jumpsuit. Jump as normal.
     

2. Check-in for your Inspection with the JumpMastre.
   If you pass, you'll be issued the Parachute. Your 
   Loadout in the Backpack will be saved on your FRONT.

3. Board the Aircraft and check-in with the Crewmaster.
   You'll transition into the Selected HALO Aircraft.

   -To use the Altimeter, use your 'Watch' button/key;
    HOLD for a few seconds to get it to pop on

    	(Custom Keys can be set in the Main Menu)

4. WAIT for the GO/Green Light --> JUMP!   Good Luck!!!
   *If you jump too soon, you will be off-course.

5. HALO/Para Menu: [SHIFT] + [H]




***FOR BEST RESULTS, THE HOST PC SHOULD BE IN CHARGE!
   THE HOST/SERVER SHOULD BE THE ONE RE-ROUTING PLANE,
   AND BE IN THE JUMP PLANE WITH EVERYONE ELSE FOR MP.

****MP ONLY has LIMITED SUPPORT.  Be Advised!  W-I-P
