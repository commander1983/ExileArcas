User Custom Keybindings v0.0.9
==============================

IF custom options are availible, 
they can be found in Main MENU:


Menu >> Configure >> Controls >> Configure Addons

1. HALO/Para............. [SHIFT] + [H]
2. Scout/Sniper.......... [SHIFT] + [S]
3. Combat Diver.......... tba
4. E.O.D................. tba
5. Spooks................ tba
6. SOCOM................. tba
7. D.A.R.K............... tba
8. CORE.................. tba




*NOTE: You MUST load a Map First, and assign the
 Keys then. Settings will be saved from then on.

 You may have to wait for several seconds for the
 mod to load into the map/game before access.




		*** Experimental ***

I like idea of having just 1 KEY to remember for
the FULL Menu option. More on this later...
